Hello! This is my About Me project. This website is the the first of soon to be many different websites that I will create.

During the production of this website I learned many things. Such as different headers, contrasting colors effectively, inserting images/videos/fonts, adding contact fourms, and more. 

For everything I have learned to insert, I also had to learn how to style them, such using display functions, flex-directions, margins, border, inserting media, and more. 

All of my code has comments to see exactly what I was adding to my project.

The Colors I used in my project are

#cdc5b4 C0FAA7 whitesmoke #333

    I reserve all copywrite on this website
